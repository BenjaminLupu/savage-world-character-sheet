# Savage Worlds Character Sheet
A role-playing classic: the homemade character sheet. This one if for the Savage Worlds roleplaying game. Beyond the pleasure of designing **a character sheet**, the various sheets available here and there (including the official one) didn't completely satisfy me. So I set about creating my own.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not familiar with **Savage Worlds**, it could well be your next **roleplaying game**. Savage Worlds is a classless game focused on a **fun, fast-paced, action-packed experience**. Savage Worlds lets you play in an infinite number of worlds. Fantasy? Espionage? Space opera? Superheroes? Savage Worlds gets you covered. [It's your next stop for adventure](https://peginc.com/savage-settings/savage-worlds/).

A few things to know about these character sheets:
- First, they are **free to use**. It's up to you to make what suits you the most.
- They are **available in English and French** in **PDF format**.
- I also supply the **Affinity Designer files** (the software I used to create them).
- I picked up two ideas I'd spotted while researching:
  - I've put together the Attributes and their Skills. I've noticed that it helps players when managing an Advance.
  - I've also integrated Edges into a list in the Advances history. Here too, it's very useful to know how the character has evolved over time.
  - The strongest choice is to have **no counters** (e.g. Wounds, Bennies, etc.) on the character sheet. I prefer to manage them separately on a dedicated sheet, with dice or with the help of my little **Counter Trackers project**.

> You'll notice a QR code in the top right-hand corner of the character sheet. This code points to a small utility allowing players to manage their counters on their phones during game sessions. This is one of my other little projects. Please find more about it here: https://github.com/BenjaminLupu/savage-worlds-counter-trackers
